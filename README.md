# IDEA Snazzy Light
I am using the popular [snazzy theme](https://github.com/sindresorhus/iterm2-snazzy) for iTerm2.
The dark theme is fine for me when it comes to independent terminal windows.
However, I use a light IntelliJ theme, so using [a dark IntelliJ terminal theme](https://github.com/JordanForeman/idea-snazzy) looks kind of odd.

This is why I created this light snazzy theme just for the IntelliJ terminal.
It is almost completely identical to [this VS Code snazzy light theme](https://github.com/loilo/vscode-snazzy-light) except for the yellow color.

## Installation

1. Download the `.icls` file
2. In IntelliJ (or any other JetBrains IDE) open Settings > Editor > Color Scheme > Console Colors
3. Click the gear button next to _Scheme_ and import the file
